<p>I have successfully completed one week of coding bootcamp. We're still in the 
pre-work stage of things, so I haven't been to class yet, but I've been busy at 
home.</p>

<p>Given the workload, I'm glad I set this blog up before we were given 
assignments. It took the better part of four days to get this up and running 
with a bare minimum of styling. But! I had it ready beforehand, and now I need 
to start using it.</p>

<p>Last week was a week of fundamentals. I completed the first 12 
<a href="http://anyonecanlearntocode.com/screencasts/">screencasts</a> over 
at ACLTC's website. I've already gone over this before, over at 
<a href ="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> but something that I 
noticed this time around is that I'm able to be much more creative. When I was 
first leaning about loops and Boolean logic and variables, the Codecademy 
lessons would say something like, "Make up whatever you like using a while loop
 (for instance)" and I would freeze up. I wouldn't be able think of _anything_ 
 to put in a while loop.</p>

<p>Going over the same material now, having had a few months experience writing 
stupid little programs, it's much easy to stretch my creative muscles. I 
haven't felt that panic to try to think of anything with a blank mind. I find 
myself excited to start the next assignment. It's an encouraging feeling.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, our instructor, Jay, just emailed me about Week 2, 
assignments. I'm itching to stay ahead of schedule, so I'm going to give them 
a look.</p>
