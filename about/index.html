	<p>Christopher Walsh was born in Chicago and returned there after a childhood 
	bouncing around the country (Memphis, Reno, Detroit, Dallas). He has a BA in 
	English from Texas A&M University and an MA in Writing from DePaul. A lover of 
	stories, he laments any time spent on public transportation without a book and 
	likes to finish his days reading until he falls asleep, hiding the light as best 
	he can from his sleepy partner.</p>
	
	<p>He enjoys ranting about cultures both high and low and is writing the second
	draft of a novel set on a fictional Mediterranean island in 1094, the year before 
	the First Crusade. In his spare time, he teaches himself how to code, photoshops 
	Magic: The Gathering art on his new tumblr, and wrestles his dog, Hector, for 
	dominance. Sometimes Hector lets him win.</p>
