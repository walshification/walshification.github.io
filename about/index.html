<section class="content">
	<p>I was born in Chicago and returned there after a childhood bouncing around the 
	country (Memphis, Reno, Detroit, Dallas). I have a BA in 	English from 
	Texas A&M University and an MA in Writing from DePaul. A lover of stories, I 
	lament any time spent on public transportation without a book and like to 
	finish my days reading until I fall asleep, hiding the light as best I can from 
	my sleepy partner.</p>
	
	<p>I enjoy ranting about cultures both high and low and am writing the second draft 
	of a novel set on a fictional Mediterranean island in 1094, the year before 
	the First Crusade. In my spare time, I teach myself how to code, photoshops 
	Magic: The Gathering art on my new tumblr, and wrestle my dog, Hector, for 
	dominance. Sometimes Hector lets me win.</p>
