	<h3>I was born in Chicago and returned there after a childhood bouncing around the 
	country (Memphis, Reno, Detroit, Dallas). I have been teaching myself to code for 
	the past six months and have finally decided to get serious about it in order to 
	start a career. This blog will chronicle the progress I make while enrolled in 
	<a href="http://anyonecanlearntocode.com/">Anyone Can Learn to Code</a>.</h3>
