# tosdr.txt is the easiest way to get your service added to the ToS;DR Database.
# Simply provide Domains and Documents in a simple format in this file, so our crawler can automatically add your service.
#
# Each document requires the following keys to be set:
#
# Document-Name     - The Name of your document. e.g. "Privacy Policy"
# Document-Url      - The Full url to your document e.g. "https://tosdr.org/legal"
# Path              - The XPath of your document. Read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath
#
# If none of these 3 keys are not given, your tosdr.txt is invalid. If you do not know how to set an XPath, use the value "//body"
#
#
# To define the domains and subdomains of your service use the following key:
#
# Domains           - Comma separated list of domains without www prefix or paths. e.g. "tosdr.org,subdomain.tosdr.org,another.subdomain.tosdr.org"
#
#
# If your service already exists in our Database, you can set the "ID" key as we do not update documents when this key is not given.
#
# ID                - Your Service ID
#
# Note: Your domain including top level domain HAS to match one of the urls in the database. If it does not, the ID key is skipped during parsing.
#
# Did you know you can use inline comments as well? See below!
